# m365-copilot-proxy

Use Microsoft 365 Copilot as an LLM backend for OpenAI-compatible coding agents like [pi](https://pi.dev/) and [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/). Wraps M365 Copilot's WebSocket/SignalR API in an OpenAI-compatible interface with tool calling support.

> **Want the gory protocol details?** See [docs/m365-copilot-api.md](docs/m365-copilot-api.md) — a full write-up of M365 Copilot's undocumented WebSocket API: auth, SignalR frames, tones/models, throttling, the "Disengaged" filter, and the Copilot Studio agent trick that makes tool calling work.

## How it works

M365 Copilot uses a SignalR WebSocket protocol, not the OpenAI API. This project translates between the two:

1. **Standalone proxy** — HTTP server with `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models` endpoints. Works with any OpenAI-compatible client (pi, OpenClaw, etc.).
2. **OpenClaw plugin** — Config generator + setup CLI for OpenClaw's provider system.

### Tool calling

M365 Copilot doesn't support OpenAI-style `tool_calls` natively. Instead, tools are
emulated via a **Markdown-fence format** (the JSON `{"tool":...}` format was removed —
it scored 0/5 on real agentic tasks; see [hypotheses §9](docs/hypotheses.md)):

- Tool definitions are injected into the prompt as fenced templates inside a `<tools>` block
- The model emits a fenced tool call — a code block whose info-string is the tool name
  (scalar args as `key: value` header lines, one free-form body arg as the fence body,
  `old`/`new` edits as aider-style `SEARCH/REPLACE` diffs)
- The proxy/handler parses that and converts it to OpenAI `tool_calls` format
- **Shell-routing (the key lever):** M365's chat-tuned model won't "act as an agent" on
  demand but *will* reflexively write a ```` ```bash ```` block. When the toolset includes a
  shell tool (`bash`/`shell`/`run`/`run_command`/… — any name), the proxy injects "do the
  whole step by writing one ```` ```bash ```` block" framing and routes that block to the
  shell tool. This exploits the one agentic behavior Microsoft's system prompt permits, and
  is what turns 0/5 into real multi-turn loops (verified 9-tool-call bug fix).
- **Reliability comes from the Copilot Studio agent (below) + the fenced/shell framing** —
  without the agent, M365 ignores tool instructions and answers in prose

### Agent mode

On first use, the system creates a **Copilot Studio agent** with tool-calling instructions baked into its server-side system prompt. This is done via the PowerPlatform API:

1. Discovers the environment URL via the BAP API (`api.bap.microsoft.com`)
2. Creates a bot with instructions in the Copilot Studio `minimalBots` API
3. Publishes the bot to get a `TitleId`
4. Uses the agent ID (`T_{titleId}.{botId}.gpt.default`) in WebSocket chat requests
5. Caches the agent ID in `~/.config/opencode-m365/agent-id.json`

### Conversation reuse

Each agent session reuses the same M365 conversation (same `sessionId` + `conversationId`). The WebSocket reconnects per turn but M365 maintains server-side context. This saves quota — the 600 message limit applies per-conversation.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+
- pnpm 10+
- An M365 account with Copilot access
- A way to sign in, either:
  - **TOTP-based MFA with the base32 secret in hand** — the automated login types the
    6-digit code itself, so it needs the seed, not an app on your phone. See
    [Getting the TOTP secret](#getting-the-totp-secret). This is the headless-friendly
    option; prefer it if your tenant allows it.
  - **or a display and 30 seconds** — set `M365_ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_APPROVAL=1` and sign
    in by hand once. Required if your tenant has [no TOTP option](#if-your-tenant-has-no-totp-option)
    (push-only MFA, FIDO2, Okta/Ping/Duo).

### 1. Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cramt/m365-copilot-proxy
cd m365-copilot-proxy
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### 2. Configure credentials

Create `~/.config/opencode-m365/secrets.json`:

```json
{
  "email": "you@company.com",
  "password": "your-password",
  "mfaSecret": "YOUR_TOTP_BASE32_SECRET"
}
```

`mfaSecret` is the **base32 seed** your authenticator app derives its 6-digit codes
from — not a code itself. It looks like `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`: 16–32 characters, `A`–`Z`
and `2`–`7` only, no spaces.

#### Getting the TOTP secret

**Already using a password manager for TOTP? Just read it back out.** 1Password,
Bitwarden, KeePassXC, Aegis, Ente Auth and friends all keep the seed and will show it
on demand — open the item's one-time-password field and reveal it. You'll get either a
bare base32 string or an `otpauth://totp/...?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP&...` URI; in the
second case the `secret=` parameter is the bit you want. No re-enrollment needed.

**If the seed is trapped in Microsoft Authenticator, enroll a second method.** That app
deliberately never exposes it, and Microsoft's security-info page won't re-display the
key after enrollment either — between them that's the only case where the seed is
genuinely unrecoverable. Enroll a fresh entry and copy it on the way past:

1. Go to <https://aka.ms/mfasetup> (**My Account → Security info**).
2. **Add sign-in method → Authenticator app**.
3. Click **"I want to use a different authenticator app"**. This step is the one that
   matters — the default path assumes Microsoft Authenticator and registers a
   push-only method with no seed you can extract.
4. At the QR-code screen, click **"Can't scan image?"**. It reveals a **Secret key** —
   that's your base32 string.
5. Generate a code from it to finish enrollment — `oathtool --totp -b <secret>`, or
   paste the seed into your password manager — and enter that code.

Store it somewhere that will give it back (see above) so this is a one-time chore. The
new entry sits alongside your existing sign-in methods; you don't have to remove
Microsoft Authenticator.

#### If your tenant has no TOTP option

Plenty of tenants can't do the above, and then there is no seed to extract:

- the authenticator-app / software-OATH method is disabled by tenant policy;
- MFA is push / number-matching only, FIDO2, Windows Hello, or certificate-based;
- sign-in is federated to a third-party IdP (Okta, Ping, Duo) that owns the MFA step.

The stored-credentials flow above cannot work in those cases — the automated login has
no code to type, and no amount of configuration fixes that.

**Use interactive approval instead.** Skip `secrets.json` entirely and set:

```sh
export M365_ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_APPROVAL=1
m365-proxy 4141
```

A real browser window opens; you complete SSO/MFA by hand exactly as you would in
Outlook — push, FIDO2, Okta, whatever your tenant enforces. The proxy captures the
resulting OAuth code and from then on refreshes tokens silently from the MSAL cache,
so the window is a **one-time cost**, not a per-run prompt. It also kicks in when
stored credentials exist but stop working (policy change, MFA method swap).

Contributed by [@EatonWu](https://github.com/EatonWu). Two honest caveats:

- It is **opt-in on purpose.** Without the flag a headless host (systemd, CI, a second
  PC) fails loudly instead of hanging on a window nobody can see. Set
  `M365_NO_INTERACTIVE=1` to veto it outright.
- The redirect capture and token exchange are the same ones the automated path uses in
  production, but **nobody has yet run this end to end against a federated Okta/Ping/Duo
  tenant.** If that's you, please report in
  [#4](https://github.com/cramt/m365-copilot-proxy/issues/4) — working or not.

> **Not device code.** The obvious headless alternative — `login.microsoft.com/device`

#### First run

On first run, the system does an automated browser login (via Playwright/Chromium) to get OAuth tokens. After that, tokens refresh silently from the MSAL cache.

### 3. Use with pi (or any OpenAI-compatible agent)

Start the proxy:

```sh
m365-proxy 4143        # or: pnpm run proxy 4143
```

Point [pi](https://pi.dev/) at it via `~/.pi/agent/models.json`:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "m365": {
      "baseUrl": "http://localhost:4143/v1",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "apiKey": "m365",
      "compat": {
        "supportsDeveloperRole": false,
        "supportsReasoningEffort": false,
        "supportsUsageInStreaming": false
      },
      "models": [
        { "id": "gpt-5.5-think-deeper", "name": "M365 Copilot (GPT-5.5, recommended)" },
        { "id": "m365-copilot", "name": "M365 Copilot (Auto)" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Then run pi (use `gpt-5.5-think-deeper` — the reliable tool-calling model — and keep the
toolset lean; M365 "disengages" on very large tool payloads, see
[docs/m365-copilot-api.md](docs/m365-copilot-api.md#the-disengaged-filter)):

```sh
pi --models "gpt-5.5-think-deeper" -p --tools read,list,edit,write "your task"
```

This is verified working end-to-end, including multi-tool calls and real file edits.

### 4. Use with OpenClaw

```sh
# Configure and start in one command
m365-openclaw-setup --start

# Or configure only, then start separately
m365-openclaw-setup
m365-proxy 4141
```

The proxy uses session reuse and delta messages — follow-up turns only send new messages, saving M365 quota. New conversations are detected automatically when the message array shrinks or the first user message changes.

### 5. Use as standalone proxy

```sh
npx m365-proxy 4141
# or
pnpm run dev
```

Then point any OpenAI-compatible client at `http://localhost:4141/v1`.

### 6. Run on NixOS (systemd service)

The proxy is a [Nitro](https://nitro.build/) service. The flake exposes a package
(built from the workspace via [pnpm2nix](https://github.com/cramt/pnpm2nix)) and a NixOS
module:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs.m365.url = "github:cramt/m365-copilot-proxy";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, m365, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.myhost = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        m365.nixosModules.default
        {
          services.m365-copilot-proxy = {
            enable = true;
            # JSON with { email, password, mfaSecret } — kept out of the Nix store,
            # delivered via systemd LoadCredential. Manage with sops-nix/agenix.
            secretsFile = "/run/secrets/m365-copilot.json";
            # port = 4141;          # default
            # host = "127.0.0.1";   # default — do not expose; unauthenticated, paid account
            # openFirewall = false;
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

The service runs as a hardened `DynamicUser` unit. Auth state (`msal-cache.json`,
`agent-id.json`) persists in `/var/lib/m365-copilot-proxy`; a fresh deploy self-bootstraps
via headless login using `secretsFile` + the bundled Chromium. To run the package directly
without NixOS: `nix run github:cramt/m365-copilot-proxy -- 4141`.

## Available models

| Model ID | M365 Tone | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gpt-5.6-think-deeper` | Gpt_5_6_Reasoning | GPT-5.6 reasoning — live-validated; agent/tool reliability not yet benchmarked |
| `gpt-5.5-think-deeper` | Gpt_5_5_Reasoning | **Recommended default for agents/tool-calling** — robust tool compliance |
| `gpt-5.5` / `gpt-5.5-quick` | Gpt_5_5_Chat | GPT-5.5 fast |
| `m365-copilot` / `auto` | magic | Auto-routing — high-variance at tool-calling (confabulates; see below) |
| `quick` | Gpt_Quick | Fast responses |
| `think-deeper` | Gpt_Reasoning | Slower, more thorough |
| `claude` / `claude-sonnet` | Claude_Sonnet | Real Anthropic Claude (agent-less path) |
| `claude-sonnet-think-deeper` | Claude_Sonnet_Reasoning | Claude reasoning |
| `gpt-5.4` / `gpt-5.4-quick` | Gpt_5_4_* | GPT-5.4 |
| `gpt-5.3` / `gpt-5.3-think-deeper` | Gpt_5_3_* | GPT-5.3 |
| `gpt-5.2` / `gpt-5.2-think-deeper` | Gpt_5_2_* | GPT-5.2 |

> ✅ **For tool calling, use `gpt-5.5-think-deeper` (the default when no model is sent).**

## Image generation

M365 Copilot generates images through a built-in server-side tool, and the core
package exposes it as one call. The picture comes back on a `GraphicArt` frame as
a URL (never as chat text), and the bytes sit behind a separate auth boundary —
`generateImage()` handles both, returning the image with bytes attached:

```ts
import { generateImage } from "@m365-copilot/core";

const [img] = await generateImage("A minimalist flat-design logo of a lighthouse, teal and white.");
// img.data      -> Buffer (real PNG, verified end-to-end)
// img.base64    -> same bytes, ready for an OpenAI-style b64_json response
// img.contentType, img.size, img.orientation
```

Everything the M365 web client can do is reachable — the proxy sends the same image
optionsSets it does. Steer type and aspect with options (they nudge the prompt the
way the GUI's meta-prompting does; the model still makes the final call):

```ts
await generateImage("a lighthouse on a cliff", { orientation: "portrait" });   // landscape | portrait | square
await generateImage("a lighthouse", { style: "icon" });                        // natural | icon | story | designer
```

**You don't have to call `generateImage` at all.** Just like the web client, a plain
chat turn draws when asked — send `"draw me an image of a green teapot"` to
`/v1/chat/completions` (or `ModelSession.run`) with no tools and the image comes back
embedded in the reply as a markdown data-URI. (Image gen is enabled on the agent-less
path only, so it never competes with tool calling; set `M365_NO_IMAGE_GEN=1` to force
pure text.)

Runs its own agent-less session. Uses the same login as chat; the artifact fetch uses
a `designerappservice` token acquired silently from the existing cache. Protocol
write-up: [docs/hypotheses.md §14](docs/hypotheses.md).

> **Separate, scarcer budget.** Image generation draws on its own daily quota, distinct
> from the ~600-message conversation limit and not metered by the chat throttle — treat
> image calls as the expensive ones. When it's exhausted, `generateImage()` throws
> `ImageGenerationError` with `reason: "quota_exceeded"` (map it to HTTP 429); a plain
> chat turn instead returns M365's "can't generate any more images today" message as text.

An OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/images/generations` endpoint on top of this is the
next step — the core API it needs is already in place.

## Authentication

The auth flow uses Azure MSAL with PKCE:

1. **Silent refresh** — cached tokens from `~/.config/opencode-m365/msal-cache.json`. The
   normal path; costs nothing and opens nothing.
2. **Automated login** — headless Playwright browser driving the AAD form with stored
   credentials + a TOTP code generated from `mfaSecret`.
3. **Interactive approval** — visible browser, human completes SSO/MFA (§13). Only when
   `M365_ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_APPROVAL=1`, and only after step 2 is unavailable or has
   actually failed. This is the path for tenants where no TOTP seed exists.

All three redeem the code against `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient`
with PKCE. That redirect isn't a stylistic choice: the client is Microsoft's own Copilot app
(the Sydney scopes are granted to no other), so nobody can register a loopback URI — a
generated `http://localhost:<port>` callback is rejected with `AADSTS50011`, and the device-code
grant demands a `client_secret` only Microsoft holds (`AADSTS7000218`). Both measured live in
[§13](docs/hypotheses.md); don't spend probes re-deriving them.

Three token scopes are acquired:
- `substrate.office.com/sydney/*` — For M365 Copilot chat
- `api.powerplatform.com/.default` — For Copilot Studio agent management
- `api.bap.microsoft.com/.default` — For environment discovery

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `M365_DEBUG` | Set to `1` to enable debug logging to `~/.config/opencode-m365/debug.log` (truncated payloads) |
| `M365_TRACE` | Set to `1` for full, untruncated debug logging (every WS frame/prompt/response) — implies `M365_DEBUG`. For reverse engineering. |
| `M365_LOG_STDOUT` | Set to `1` to mirror debug lines to the proxy's stdout as well as the log file, so you can watch a run without tailing it in a second terminal. Needs `M365_DEBUG` or `M365_TRACE` — on its own it logs nothing. |
| `M365_DUMP_FRAMES` | Set to `1` to write every WebSocket frame (both directions) to `~/.config/opencode-m365/frames/<requestId>.ndjson`. For offline diffing of new M365 fields. |
| `M365_ALLOW_MULTI_TOOL` | Allow the model to emit multiple tool calls per turn (default: only the first is kept) |
| `M365_INJECT_REPLY_TOOL` | Set to `1` to inject a synthetic `reply(text)` tool. Forces every turn to be a tool call, including pure-prose answers. Cleaner contract for the model, +1 tool to the prompt (watch the Disengaged threshold). Confirmed 5/5 compliance on June 9 2026 ([hypotheses §1.1](docs/hypotheses.md)). |
| `M365_NO_CONFAB_RETRY` / `M365_CONFAB_RETRIES` | M365's chat model sometimes produces prose instead of a tool call when it should act — either confabulating an inability ("I can't access the files, please paste them") **or** claiming a completion it never did ("I've replaced the README", with no tool call). By default the proxy detects both and re-prompts forcefully **in the same conversation** (`M365_CONFAB_RETRIES`, default `1`) to force a real action. Set `M365_NO_CONFAB_RETRY=1` to disable. |
| `M365_NO_BACKOFF` (alias `M365_NO_AUTO_REAUTH`) | Set to `1` to disable degradation backoff. By default, when empty/throttled responses span several **distinct conversations** in a short window (the thread-rate-throttle signature, [F13](docs/hypotheses.md)), the proxy **paces subsequent turns** (a jittered delay before starting new backend conversations) to let the account self-heal. This replaced the old auto-reauth: a fresh login does **not** clear this throttle (it's `oid`-keyed — [§11 H-R1](docs/hypotheses.md)) and raised our detection profile. A single long pi thread never trips the trigger. |
| `M365_BACKOFF_THRESHOLD` / `M365_BACKOFF_WINDOW_MS` / `M365_BACKOFF_BASE_MS` / `M365_BACKOFF_MAX_MS` | Tune backoff: distinct-conversation empties to trigger (default `3`), the window they must fall in (default `120000`), the initial pacing window (default `90000`), and its escalation cap (default `600000`). |
| `M365_BROWSER_PROFILE` / `M365_LOGIN_UA` | Override the persistent browser-profile dir and the login User-Agent. The UA defaults to one naming **this host's** OS, replacing headless Chromium's `HeadlessChrome/<v>` tell without claiming to be a different platform; the automated path sets it, the user-driven interactive path sends nothing unless you set this ([§15 F33](docs/hypotheses.md)). The persistent profile keeps AAD SSO/device cookies so repeat logins are silent and look like a familiar device ([§11 H-R3](docs/hypotheses.md)). |
| `M365_ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_APPROVAL` | Set to `1` to allow a **visible** browser window for sign-in when the automated login can't work or fails — the fallback for tenants with no TOTP option (push-only MFA, FIDO2, Okta/Ping/Duo). You complete SSO/MFA by hand once; tokens refresh silently afterwards. Off by default so headless hosts fail loudly rather than hang. See [If your tenant has no TOTP option](#if-your-tenant-has-no-totp-option). |
| `M365_NO_INTERACTIVE` | Set to `1` to hard-disable any visible browser login, overriding the flag above. For systemd/CI hosts where a window must never open. |
| `M365_INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` | How long to wait for you to finish the interactive sign-in (default `600000`, i.e. 10 minutes). |
| `M365_LOGIN_LOCALE` / `M365_LOGIN_TIMEZONE` | Pin the browser locale and timezone presented during login. **Unset by default** — Chromium derives both from the OS, which is what a real browser reports; only set them if you need to pin specific values ([§15 F33](docs/hypotheses.md)). |
| `M365_CACHE_FILE` | Override MSAL token cache location |
| `M365_SECRETS_FILE` | Override credentials file location |
| `CHROMIUM_PATH` | Path to Chromium binary for automated login |

### Usage / context-window % in responses

The OpenAI `usage` block in every chat completion response now includes M365
extension fields with the **per-conversation message quota** — the closest
proxy we have to "context-window utilisation" since M365 hides token counts:

```json
"usage": {
  "prompt_tokens": 0,
  "completion_tokens": 0,
  "total_tokens": 0,
  "x_m365_conversation_messages": 42,
  "x_m365_conversation_max": 600,
  "x_m365_conversation_pct": 7,
  "x_m365_conversation_remaining": 558,
  "x_m365_content_origin": "DeepLeo",
  "x_m365_message_type": null,
  "x_m365_turn_count": 3,
  "x_m365_classifier_scores": {
    "BotOffense": 1.27e-7,
    "dea_violation": 2.81e-6
  },
  "x_m365_dea_score": 2.81e-6,
  "x_m365_offense_score": 1.27e-7
}
```

`x_m365_dea_score` is M365's own "disengaged-eligible answer" classifier
score — the closest signal to "am I about to get Disengaged?". Empirically:
clean tool calls sit at ~1 × 10⁻⁸, prose at ~1 × 10⁻⁶, jailbreak-shaped
prompts at ~1 × 10⁻³. Disengaged itself fires at some threshold > 2 × 10⁻³
that we haven't yet pinpointed. Clients can monitor this to back off before
tripping the filter.

Clients that ignore unknown extension fields keep working; curious users can
read them. See [docs/hypotheses.md §0](docs/hypotheses.md) for the full
findings dump and [§2](docs/hypotheses.md) for what we tried and didn't find.

## Config files

All stored in `~/.config/opencode-m365/`:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `secrets.json` | Login credentials (email, password, mfaSecret) |
| `msal-cache.json` | MSAL token cache (auto-managed) |
| `agent-id.json` | Cached Copilot Studio agent ID |
| `debug.log` | Debug log (when `M365_DEBUG=1`) |

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build            # Build all packages
pnpm run dev          # Start standalone proxy on :4141
pnpm run test:unit    # Run vitest unit tests (no auth/network)
pnpm run test:live    # Run live integration tests against M365
```

## Known limitations

- **M365 "disengages" on large tool payloads** — heavy agent harnesses (e.g. opencode's ~15-tool prompt) get empty `Disengaged` responses. Keep the toolset lean (this is why [pi](https://pi.dev/) works well). A heavy harness can be trimmed to fit, though opencode in particular needs that done in the proxy rather than through its own config, and its tool count has since dropped — see [docs/m365-copilot-api.md](docs/m365-copilot-api.md#the-disengaged-filter).
- Tool calling is emulated (prompt injection + a Copilot Studio agent), not native function calling — robust with the agent, unreliable without it
- The `think-deeper` / `*_Reasoning` models take 10-30s per response
- Hard quota of ~600 messages **per conversation** (mitigated by session reuse + delta sends)
- Streaming: **tool-less** responses stream incrementally (deltas forwarded as they arrive). **Tool-calling** turns are still buffered server-side — the raw text has to be parsed for tool-call fences before it can be emitted — so those arrive as a single chunk at the end (with an immediate HTTP 200 + heartbeats so the client never times out waiting)
